# Android Web App Launcher

This is only a test project but can use for simple applications. The idea is, build a web page like a web application. But instead display the browser, convert it into a app.
Remember that the user has no back- or forward-button within that application and canÂ´t mark certain pages as favorit like in the normal browser. The web application should develop 
with this in mind. Each page have to test if the user can reach all other pages.

**Project build with "androidStudio"**
